# ðŸ“ˆ San Francisco MERS Pension Fund Allocation Analysis

## Overview


This project analyzes a hypothetical asset allocation strategy of San Franciscoâ€™s **Municipal Employeesâ€™ Retirement System (MERS)**, particularly in light of unusual losses in **2022** and elevated volatility from **2023â€“2024**. The MERS fund, currently valued at **$525 million**, follows a traditional **60/40 portfolio** (60% U.S. large-cap equities / 40% fixed income).

To strengthen the fundâ€™s resilience, our client is considering a **$175 million top-up** using **COVID relief funds**. This top-up increases the total fund value to **$700 million** and opens the door to more conservative allocation strategies that reduce insolvency risk while optimizing long-term performance.

We use the **AIRG Economic Scenario Generator (ESG)** to test portfolio allocations over a 30-year horizon, focusing on:
- Insolvency risk
- Expected surplus
- Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted returns)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Findings

- **2022 Losses:** The fund experienced sporadic losses (â‰¥15%), which pose serious risks to liquidity and solvency.
- **2023â€“2024 Volatility:** Prolonged market uncertainty contributed to sustained high volatility, increasing downside risk.
- **Rare Event Probability:** Our ESG model estimates only a **1.51% chance** of such high annual losses under a standard 60/40 portfolio, reinforcing the rarity of these events.
